# Module-1_challenge_Kisckstarter-Challenge
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Overview of Project
We used two types of Analysis here and created graph representation for both:
•	Theater Outcome by Launch Date: Using this analysis, we tried to see if the campaign was successful, Failed or Canceled based on the Parent Category (example: Theater) for each month
•	Outcome Based on Goals: It was about the Outcomes successful, Failed or Canceled based on the goal ranges.

Analysis and Challenges: Please see the attached images for the analysis we have done. 
I didn’t find or encountered any challenges while doing this analysis. 
Only challenge was we have to write COUNTIF formula for each row separately based on the Goal range. There was repletion in writing the code for each row.
The possible challenges could be – 
•	If we have to create the intervals in Outcome based on Goals by creating our own formula.
•	If we have to use VLOOKUP or find Outliers in this analysis.

Two conclusions that we can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:
•	Theater campaign performed well in the month of May and June but the performance of the campaigns degraded after June.
•	In the month of October, no campaign was canceled.

Conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals:
Subcategory: “Plays” campaign were not canceled at all. We have highest successful campaigns for the Goal amount less than 1000.
What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	This data set does not tell us if a campaign was failed what the reason behind it was. 
•	Which audience we have targeted – Gender and Age group

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
•	We can create the tables based on the 
•	How campaigns have performed at Country level.
•	How different Subcategories has performed.
•	Comparison between Goals and Pledged.
